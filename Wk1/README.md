This course uses Python 3.4.  There are a few changes in Python 3.5 that are not compatible with this course, so for the best experience please download and use Python 3.4. The main Python website contains links to downloads and documentation. Here are some brief instructions:

Download and install Python 3.4: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343/. (Please do not install Python 2: you need Python 3.)
* Linux users: use your package manager to install Python 3.4.
* Windows users: choose the "Windows x86 MSI Installer" from the downloads page.
* Mac OS X users: choose the "Mac OS X 32-bit i386/PPC installer" from the downloads page.
* OS X users only: install ActiveTcl 8.5.18.0.

The Python Standard Library contains descriptions of many Python features. It contains much more information than we will be able to cover in this course, and may seem overwhelming at first, but if you continue to program in Python after this course you'll find it useful. The programming environment we use is IDLE, the software we use to write Python programs. IDLE comes with Python.

# The Python Visualizer:
We provide software that helps you visualize program execution. We introduce this in our week 2 video lectures.

# Textbook: Practical Programming
This material in this course is based off of the content of our textbook.  This online course is intended to be self-contained, and thus the textbook is optional, but should you want more reading material with additional examples and exercises, our textbook follows the syllabus quite closely. You can choose to purchase an electronic version (PDF, ePub, mobi) instead of a paper book. The price for the electronic version is $25 USD.
